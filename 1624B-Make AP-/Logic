The idea is to check if the first element can be changed to make AP, then try the second and then third.
The way we will do that is, we will first calculate difference(d) of AP considering the other two elements are in AP.

With the difference in hand, we will check if the number required to complete the AP can be made by multiplying a positive integer to the element. 
We will do this with help of Modulo Operator.
