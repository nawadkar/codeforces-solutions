Polycarp has 3 positive integers a, b and c. He can perform the following operation exactly once.

Choose a positive integer m and multiply exactly one of the integers a, b or c by m.
Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers a, b, c (in this order) forms an arithmetic progression? Note that you cannot change the order of a, b and c.

Formally, a sequence x1,x2,…,xn is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number d (called "common difference") such that xi+1=xi+d for all i from 1 to n−1. In this problem, n=3.

For example, the following sequences are AP: [5,10,15], [3,2,1], [1,1,1], and [13,10,7]. The following sequences are not AP: [1,2,4], [0,1,0] and [1,3,2].

You need to answer t independent test cases.
